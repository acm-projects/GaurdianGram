Going on a date or out on the town for a big night? This app will allow you to do so safely-- with a twist. Enter the start and end time of your function/outing OR activate Al Fresco mode. This will allow the app to send you a notification at a randomized time during your outing to prompt you for a quick selfie and caption! This will be broadcasted to your safety network-- this is fun. The safe: once you are in Al Fresco mode, and feel unsafe or uncomfortable at any point, simply toggle The Big Button-- this will send out a Distress Alarm to your safety network. To deactivate your alarm, enter your pin.

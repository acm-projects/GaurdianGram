# Hello! -AK
# How are you today?


# GuardianGram
Going on a date or out on the town for a big night? This app will allow you to do so safely-- with a twist. Enter the start and end time of your function/outing OR activate Al Fresco mode. This will allow the app to send you a notification at a randomized time during your outing to prompt you for a quick selfie and caption! This will be broadcasted to your safety network-- this is fun. The safe: once you are in Al Fresco mode, and feel unsafe or uncomfortable at any point, simply toggle The Big Button-- this will send out a Distress Alarm to your safety network. To deactivate your alarm, enter your pin.

- Ability to add users to a safety network
- Location tracker for sending safety network real time location update after a Distress Alarm
- Notification system for a "GuardianGram" alert <br>
    - Shoot notification at randomized time according to user‚Äôs inputted start and end time
    - Shoot notification at randomized time while in Al Fresco mode
    - A user from the safety network is given a ‚Äúkey‚Äù, which allows them to send their friend a GaurdianGram at any point while they‚Äôre in Al Fresco mode
- Ability to toggle The Big Button to set off a Distress Alarm
- Notification system for the user's safety network if a Distress Alarm is set off

## Stretch Goals üíñ
- Toggle The Big Button a certain way to categorize the user's current safety level (ex. tap The Big Button once if danger level is low, twice if it is moderate, press and hold if it is high and the user seeks immediate help)
- Using a Shake Service: whenever the phone is physically shaked a certain way, GuardianGram will open up and immediately send out a distress alarm
- Further socialization features: quick reacts to GaurdianGram posts
- Activity Timeline feature: the user can upload their upcoming activities ahead of time and broadcast it on their safety network's feed
